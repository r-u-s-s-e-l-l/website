<p>
When I first thought of starting up my own blog, there were so many things I was going to write about. Musings on faith, vulnerability, family, maybe even fear, all amongst the myriad of thoughts on my mind.
</p>

<p>
But as I finally start to work on an idea thatâ€™s been rotting away at the back of my head, there's simply nothing. Have I simply changed that much as a person, consciously choosing to avoid such thoughts in fear of inconclusive speculation. <br> <br>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps. <br> <br>
</p>

although that might not
be such a bad thing.
