<p>
When I first thought of starting up my own blog, there were so many things I was going to write about. Musings on faith, vulnerability, family, maybe even fear, amongst the myriad of thoughts on my mind.
</p>

<p>
But as I finally execute an idea that’s been sitting idly for over a year, my mind runs blank. Is it because I don’t know how to string pretentious thoughts into graceful words? Or have I simply changed that much as a person, consciously choosing to avoid such thoughts in fear of inconclusive speculation. <br> <br>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps. <br> <br>
</p>

but that might not
be such a bad thing.
